* ChangeLog

** 0.1.1 

No breaking changes.

Deprecation: ={:brepl-port 9002}= in your project.clj should replaced
by ={:brepl {:port 9002}}= - original will be removed in 0.2.0.

You can now choose the IP address to bind on, by providing (for
example) ={:brepl {:ip "0.0.0.0", :port 9002}}= in your project.clj.

Thanks to [[https://github.com/mfikes][Mike Fikes]] for his suggestion and subsequent PR.

** 0.1.0

Initial release.
